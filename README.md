# Image Classification

### Introduction
In this project, we'll classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. We'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded. Completed as part of the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101).
